 First of the three short films made by ""The Trauma Group"" (Naxo Fiol, Chema Ponze, Gabi Tintorer) on the Marvel character between 1993 and 1996. This is the first film made in Spain, shot without more budget than the spent in the costume of the hero (60,000 pesetas of 1993) and shot with a video-8 camera of the time, so the image and the sound, together with the passage of time make the quality of both very poor. Halfway between the experimental, psychotronic cinema and avant-garde cinema, it´s a very extravagant version of the character, softened in the second incursion of the Trauma Group in the character: ""Peter Parker is Spider-Man"" (1996), closer than this to the original comic.","Action, Drama",Naxo Fiol,"Naxo Fiol, Chema Ponze, Steve Ditko, Naxo Fiol, Naxo Fiol",No trailer available.

Tolkien, in an attempt to understand the work's phenomenal success and influence. The program looks for answers in the author's sources of inspiration, from the folk legends of Norway to the field of linguistics of which Tolkien was a lifelong student. It finds that the deep chord the story strikes owes its resonance to the author's use of archetypal imagery and language. Many examples of these recurrent themes and images are given, with readings from the work and other literature. Interviews with the book's illustrators, the brothers Hildebrandt, speak to the power of the imagery in the classic story. Scholars, Tolkien's children, and the author himself provide insight into the mythic themes and the spell they have cast over the vast readership of The Lord of the Rings.",Documentary,Stephen Grant,Stephen Grant,No trailer
